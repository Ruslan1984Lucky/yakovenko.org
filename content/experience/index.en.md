## Summary
I have been working in computer programming as a software tester for more than 6 years (since June 2011), contributing to medium and large-scale software projects for clients in the USA, Canada, Australia, and Germany. My experience spans web-based, desktop, and mobile applications including CMS, BI, CRM, ERP, DMS, and E-Commerce systems, often integrating with web services or standalone software.  

I primarily worked as a manual QA engineer, but also gained experience in automation testing, performance testing, web-service testing, and QA team coordination. My responsibilities included business and technical requirements analysis, communication with development teams and clients, test planning, scenario development, execution, defect reporting, and QA documentation. I am experienced as a standalone tester, regression QA team member, key tester, and QA Lead substitute. I have strong knowledge of QA processes, testing skills, and remote work experience.
