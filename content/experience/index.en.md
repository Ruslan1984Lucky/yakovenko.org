	Integration of Research Information System with a DMS to be used as external files storage
	Short Description: During the first phase, a simple solution based on Apache Chemistry was implemented just to migrate all attachments from DB and serve all clients. While files are saved in external storage, their attributes are still kept in application DB; thus, in the solution, special attention was paid to safely handling any possible exceptions to prevent orphan files or attributes if some attachment create/update/delete operation fails. Another important requirement was to improve the search server to correctly index attachment data from two sources. The team was also responsible for the file migration part in the general migration task. The second phase had to be focused on advanced integration with Alfresco, which would be used by the clients as full-scale DMS with versioning, while dedicated folders would serve for storing system attachments. The team implemented basic integration with Alfresco (i.e. to use it just as file storage with restricted access for common users) and completed several technical researches regarding security, SSO, permissions, configurable folders structure for keeping attachments, versioning etc.

The application included three access levels with specific permissions, admin tools, and easy-to-use interfaces for manual data entry.
