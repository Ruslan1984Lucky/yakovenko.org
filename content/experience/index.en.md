## Summary
I have been working in computer programming as a software tester for more than 6 years (since June 2011). During that time, I have worked on eleven medium to large software projects for customers from the USA, Canada, Australia, and Germany. Mostly those were complex web-based, desktop, mobile applications including CMS / BI / CRM / ERP / DMS / E-Commerce client-server systems with integrations into separate web services or standalone software products. On these projects, I have mainly worked as a manual QA engineer, but on some of them, I have gained practical experience in test automation, performance testing, web-service testing, and QA team coordination.
