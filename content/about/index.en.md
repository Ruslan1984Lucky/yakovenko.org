LinkedIn Summary (About)

I am a Senior QA Engineer / BI QA Architect with more than 12 years of professional experience in software testing, performance engineering, and data-driven quality assurance. Over the course of my career, I have successfully contributed to 19 international projects for clients in the USA, Canada, Europe, and Australia, spanning industries such as fintech, tax & audit analytics, e-commerce, gaming, logistics, and healthcare.

My latest role was as a QA Coach in the Data Analytics Team at Deloitte (Intela platform), where I worked across 15 Scrum teams, leading QA activities for BI & Data pipelines. My responsibilities included testing microservice flows (Normal flow, Resync, Reconciliation, Orphaned flows), database development (tables, transformations, migrations), ETL & Data Lake pipelines, Power BI dashboards/reports, performance/load testing, automation, and integration validation.

In previous roles, I worked on large-scale enterprise and cloud platforms for Oracle (ERP Cloud Services), Ryanair (mobile app), BMC (Release Process Management), Playson (omnichannel casino games), Meest (e-commerce & logistics platform), and Namecheap (domain & hosting solutions).

I also bring specialized healthcare software experience, developing and testing systems for patient monitoring, medical data management, and self-service kiosks. I hold a Healthcare Certification from Mednet, ensuring compliance with regulatory and safety standards for health-related software.

My expertise covers:

Testing & QA: Manual, Automation, Performance, Load, Stress, Integration, API, ETL validation

Data & BI: SQL, Oracle DB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Data Lake, Databricks, Power BI

Automation Tools: Selenium, Protractor, JMeter, Postman, SoapUI, ReadyAPI

Cloud & DevOps: Azure, Docker, Jenkins, CI/CD, GitHub, Azure DevOps

Healthcare QA: Certified by Mednet, experience in medical monitoring & compliance systems

I combine deep technical testing skills with data analytics expertise, making me highly effective in BI, Data, and Cloud-driven projects. My focus is always on ensuring quality, reliability, performance, and compliance while enabling teams to deliver faster and smarter.

I specialize in **BI / Data Analytics / Performance Testing / Automation**, bridging business insights with software quality.
